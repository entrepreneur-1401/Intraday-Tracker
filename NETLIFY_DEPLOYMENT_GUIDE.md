# Netlify Manual Deployment Guide - FIXED

## Issue Fixed ✅
The 404 errors were caused by:
1. **Missing SPA redirects**: Fixed with `_redirects` file
2. **Incorrect build output structure**: Fixed to output directly to `dist/` folder  
3. **Server-side routing conflicts**: Now configured for static hosting only

## Manual Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Direct Folder Upload (Recommended)

1. **Build the application locally:**
   ```bash
   ./build-static.sh
   ```

2. **Upload to Netlify:**
   - Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder to "Sites" area
   - Or click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually" → Upload `dist` folder

### Option 2: Git Repository Deployment

1. **Push your code to GitHub/GitLab**

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
   - Select your repository

3. **Build Settings:**
   - **Build command**: `./build-static.sh`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - **Environment variables**: `NODE_ENV=production`

## Important Configuration

### Netlify Settings
- **Publish directory**: `dist` (not `dist/public`)
- **Build command**: `./build-static.sh`
- **Node version**: 20.x

### Files Created for Deployment
- `build-static.sh` - Static build script (frontend only)
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration with SPA redirects
- `dist/_redirects` - React Router redirect rules (auto-generated during build)

## What's Fixed

✅ **SPA Routing**: All routes now redirect to `index.html` for React Router  
✅ **Build Output**: Files are now in `dist/` root, not nested in `dist/public/`  
✅ **Static Assets**: All CSS, JS, and image files properly referenced  
✅ **404 Errors**: Fixed with proper redirect configuration  

## Important Notes

1. **Frontend Only**: This is a static deployment (no backend server)
2. **Google Sheets Integration**: Still works via browser-side API calls
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure `VITE_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` and `VITE_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` in Netlify dashboard if needed
4. **Custom Domain**: Can be configured in Netlify dashboard after deployment

## Troubleshooting

If you still get 404 errors:
1. Verify `dist/_redirects` file exists after build
2. Check Netlify publish directory is set to `dist`
3. Ensure build command completed successfully
4. Check browser console for any asset loading errors

The application is now ready for successful Netlify static deployment!
