## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and interactions
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state (AppContext)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture  
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Data Storage**: Google Sheets integration only (no database dependencies)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper error handling
- **Development**: Vite for hot module replacement and fast builds

### Build System
- **Frontend Build**: Vite with React plugin
- **Backend Build**: esbuild for server bundling
- **Development**: Concurrent development server with Vite middleware
- **TypeScript**: Shared types between frontend and backend via `/shared` directory

## Key Components

### Data Schema
The application uses TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas for data validation:

1. **Trades**: Core trading data including entry/exit prices, P&L, emotions, and strategy references
2. **Strategies**: Strategy definitions with descriptions, screenshots, and performance tracking
3. **Psychology Entries**: Monthly psychological reflections and trading analysis
4. **Settings**: Application configuration for Google Sheets integration

### Frontend Pages
- **Dashboard**: Overview with quick stats, recent trades, calendar, and trade entry form
- **Trade Log**: Comprehensive trade management with filtering and detailed views
- **Analytics**: Charts and performance metrics with P&L tracking and win rates
- **Strategies**: Strategy management with performance tracking per strategy
- **Psychology**: Monthly reflection journaling with emotional tracking
- **Settings**: Google Sheets integration configuration

### External Integrations
- Google Sheets API integration for data synchronization
- Screenshot image preview capabilities
- Mobile-responsive calendar component for date-based trade filtering

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. React components use TanStack Query hooks for data fetching
2. API requests go through a centralized query client with error handling
3. Server responds with JSON data and proper HTTP status codes
4. Optimistic updates and cache invalidation for real-time feel

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Primary Storage**: Google Sheets via App Script integration
- **Local Cache**: In-memory storage for fast access during session
- **Auto-Sync**: All data changes automatically sync to Google Sheets
- **Local Storage**: Settings and preferences cached locally

### State Management
- Global app state managed via React Context
- Server state cached and synchronized via TanStack Query
- Form state managed locally with React Hook Form
- UI state (modals, filters) managed with local component state

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Form validation integration
- **zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting utilities

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible, unstyled UI primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **framer-motion**: Animation library for smooth transitions
- **embla-carousel-react**: Touch-friendly carousel component
- **recharts**: Charts and data visualization
- **wouter**: Lightweight routing solution

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type safety and developer experience
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: esbuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Assets**: Static files served from build directory

### Environment Configuration
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment specification (development/production)
- **VITE_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID**: Google Sheets integration ID (configured via UI)
- **VITE_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL**: Google Apps Script webhook URL (configured via UI)

### Production Considerations
- Server serves static files from `dist/public` in production
- Google Sheets integration is the primary data storage mechanism
- Mobile-responsive design ensures compatibility across devices
- PWA-ready architecture for potential app-like experience
- No database setup required - only Google Sheets integration needed

The application prioritizes performance, user experience, and data integrity while maintaining a clean, professional interface suitable for active trading environments.
