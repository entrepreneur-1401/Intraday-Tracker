Create a clean, interactive, and mobile-responsive intraday trading dashboard web app for an Indian cash market intraday trader using React.js for the frontend with Tailwind CSS for design and Framer Motion for smooth animations. The dashboard should have a Daily Trade Log form where the user can enter: Trade Date (auto or manual), Stock Name, Quantity, Entry Price, Exit Price, Stop Loss, Target Price, and it should automatically calculate Profit or Loss. Include fields like “Setup Followed” (Yes/No), “Which Setup” (dropdown list), Emotion, Notes, Psychology reflections, and a Google Drive screenshot link. All trade data must be stored in a connected Google Sheet using only Google Apps Script as the backend API. Allow the user to change the Google Sheet ID and Script URL dynamically in settings.

Add a calendar view where the user can select any date and load trades recorded on that date, including inline image preview of screenshot links. Include a Strategy Tracker section to manage strategies with setup name, description, screenshot URL, and tags (Active, Testing, Deprecated). Create a Psychology & Monthly Review section where users can log rich text entries for monthly P&L summaries, best/worst trade (linked to data), mental reflections, and improvement areas. Also include an Analytics section powered by Recharts that shows auto-generated metrics like win rate %, average win/loss, monthly P&L, equity curve, and strategy performance.

Ensure the app is lightweight, fast-loading, with modern transitions, a subtle professional theme, and full mobile responsiveness. Use demo/test data initially so features can be explored without setup. No Firebase or Mongo—all backend data and logic should be handled through Google Sheets and Apps Script only. Include full integration instructions, including how to connect to Google Sheets and deploy the app using Replit or Vercel. The final result should feel like a world-class trading control center built entirely around Google Sheets.
